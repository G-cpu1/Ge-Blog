        <p>Welcome to my personal blog. I'm a full-time college data analytics student, but I have a wide variety of interests. One of them is blogging! If you're into music recommendations, updates on projects I'm working on, or just want a glimpse into my day-to-day life, you're in the right place.</p>

        <h1>About Ge's Street Blog</h1>
        <p>Ge's Street is a personal blog that features a warm atmosphere and a slight neopolitan color scheme and inspired by neocities cards/sites.
     The blog will share day-in-the-life posts,
     music recommendations, game reviews, and projects I'm working on. 
     I aim to build a community and share various interactive activities I'm up to at the moment.
     Whether you're here for music, projects, or just to see what I'm up to, I hope you find something you enjoy!</p>
