<h1>About Ge's Street </h1>
</p>Hey, I'm Ge, a full-time college student studying data analytics and (now) blogger. I have a wide range of interests, including music, gaming, and writing. This blog is a space where I can share my thoughts, music, game recommendations, and updates on projects I'm working on. 

Music is a significant part of my life. I play a few different instruments, with
 the cello being my primary instrument for about 7 years now. I love listening to 
 music and put on to new recommendations. I hope to introduce you to some nice tunes. Check out the music 
 tab to see what is posted!

I aim to build a community and share various interactive activities I'm up to at the moment. Whether you're here for music, projects, or to see what I'm up to, I hope you find something you enjoy!</p>
