        <p>Hello hello! As I've mentioned, music is a big part of me as I not only listen to it (like most people), but I also play a few different instruments, with cello being my primary and longest-known instrument of roughly 7 years.</p>
        
        <p>Anywho, that's a post for another day, as I wanted to recommend some Jazz. Specifically, the kind that makes you feel like a detective standing in a dimly lit alley as it rains, or the kind of music that might be playing at a diner in <em>Batman: The Animated Series</em>.</p>
        <p>I assume you get my gist now, but there are all kinds of music, even jazz. So don't knock it till you try it — and roll the recs!</p>
